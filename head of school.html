        <h3>Ms.Linda LaPine,Head of School</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the International School of Hyderabad (ISH). This website will give you a glimpse into the vibrant school life experienced here by our students, parents, and faculty.</p>
        <p>Under the trusteeship of The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), our beautiful purpose-built campus is nestled within the 3,500 acres of the ICRISAT campus. Given this extraordinary environment and the wonderful climate of Hyderabad, much on-campus learning takes place beyond the classroom walls, allowing for a unique and enriching learning experience.</p>
        <p>As a parent who raised two daughters abroad, I know first-hand how significant it is that you choose the right school placement for your child. School becomes your child’s home away from home, the center of his or her social world, and the environment where she or he learns to function independently. Each day I interact with students new to our school and others who have been here many years. One of my favorite sights is the first-day welcome our students give to new joiners. Friendships with peers and relationships with teachers are quickly made at ISH.</p>
        <p>We delight in providing our holistic academic and co-curricular programs on our beautiful campus each day for all students. We are optimistic that this will continue in the future, but should there ever be a need to return to online learning for a period, I am proud to be able to promise that ISH will fulfill its mission whether the learning happens on campus or online. Our record of success in both learning scenarios guarantee that your child will thrive no matter the mode of learning.</p>
        <p>Our mission and guiding principles ensure that our students are Leading Their Own Learning. This tagline is not taken lightly here and the ISH faculty are experienced and highly skilled, taking pride in developing supportive, caring relationships as they guide each student’s personalized learning journey. High academic standards, innovative practices, and a wide variety of co-curricular school activities ensure that learning at ISH is an engaging, meaningful, and joyous experience.</p>
        <p>ISH is a warm and welcoming international community.  It is truly a special place where students, parents, faculty, and staff come together in a rich tapestry of cultures, nationalities, and experiences. Lifelong friends and cherished memories are made here as we learn, work and play together.</p>
        <p>Come Join Us!</p>
        <p>Linda LaPine</p>
