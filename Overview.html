        <p>The International School of Hyderabad (ISH) was founded in 1981 under the trusteeship of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), both non-profit organizations. This gives ISH a similar status of a school administered by a foreign/consular mission. ISH is formally managed by the Director General of ICRISAT with the help of ISH School Board guiding the Head of School in leading and managing. The Head of School is responsible for the day-to-day operations.</p>
        <p>The first IGCSE Cambridge Exams was administered in 2003 and the first IB Diploma was given in 2007, when the first class of IB students graduated from ISH. </p>
        <p>ISH was the first school in India to receive international accreditation from the Council of International Schools (CIS) and continues to be accredited by CIS and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). ISH is also the first school in Telangana (former Andhra Pradesh) to be authorized to offer the IB diploma.</p>
        <p>ISH is an English medium, co-educational day school that provides education for children between the ages of 4 to 18 years old. At present, our student body consists of over 400 students from around 22 different countries. The majority of the students at ISH are from overseas. That said, ISH is able to admit a limited number of Indian citizens. Over 34% of the ISH staff is international coming from 10 different countries. This is a really unique feature of ISH compared to other international schools in Hyderabad. The school’s preferred class size is 20 students.</p>
        <p>ISH focuses on preparing students for university and indeed almost all our students go to prestigious universities across the world, with the majority attending universities in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>ISH believes that each student is unique. The school takes an individualized and personalized approach to learning. Our aim is to encourage each student to not only strive to achieve academic excellence but also aspire to become a socially aware and responsible individual who is well-equipped to excel in a global society.</p>
